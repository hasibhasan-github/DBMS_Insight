For initializing git in your local repository ----- 

1. git init 

Connect your local repository to cloud repository

2. git remote add origin https://github.com/hasibhasan-github/DBMS_Insight.git

Now connect the your local repository with your main branch

3. git branch -M main

Now save/add the changes of your local repository

4. git add .

Now Commit your changes to your local repository

5. git commit -m "@hasibhasan-github"

Now you have to push the code to the cloud repository

6. git push -u origin main

Now you have to create Person specific branches for work. One branch for each person of the team.

7. git checkout -b Person1 main

Now let's create another branch for Person 2.

8. git checkout -b Person2 main

Now let's check how many branch do we have on our local repository.

9. git branch

Now let's push all the branches in our Cloud repository

10. git push --all origin

Great! You did it!
