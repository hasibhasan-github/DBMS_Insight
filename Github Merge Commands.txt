Now we want to merge our Person1 branch with main branch 

First of all update all the changes of your local repository to cloud repository by simply following 5,6,7. 

Now let's change our branch to main branch.

8. git checkout main 

Then fetch the latest changes from the remote repository (GitHub) to ensure you have the most up-to-date information

9. git fetch origin

Now let's merge the main branch and Person1 branch. Then all updates from Person1 will be available in main branch.

10. git merge origin/Person1

Now let's commit and push the merge to our cloud repository.

11. git commit -m "@hasibhasan-github merged Person1 into main"

12. git push origin main

You should be very careful while merging. If two people wrote code in the same line. This is going to conflict. Stay safe!
