Now we are acting as Person1 or Person2 and we will be pulling out the cloud repository in our local repository. Let's get started.

First we need to initialize the repository.

1. git init.

Then we need to connect the local repository with cloud repository

2. git remote add origin https://github.com/hasibhasan-github/DBMS_Insight.git 

Now we have to pull the existing code for Person1/Person2 from cloud to our Local repository.

3. git pull https://github.com/hasibhasan-github/DBMS_Insight.git Person1

Now let's switch to branch Person1 

4. git switch -c Person1

Now let's update the Person1 Branch in cloud repository.

5. git add .

6. git commit -m "@hasibhasan-github"

7. git push -u origin Person1

That's great you did it. Now code in your branch of Person1. After coding everytime repeat step 5,6,7.
